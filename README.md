## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm **Mohammed Wajaahath Yasin**, a driven and adaptable Junior Software Engineer with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and cloud-native backend development. I recently completed the Elixirr AI Academy and a rigorous HyperionDev bootcamp, where I built real-world software solutions using cutting-edge tools like AWS, LangChain, and vector databases.

I thrive on building clean, efficient, and scalable backend systems that solve real problems. I bring a collaborative mindset and technical curiosity to every project I work on.
